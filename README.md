### ESP8266 UV Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller with the VEML6070 UV sensor to measure Ultraviolet (UV) index. UV sensors are crucial in monitoring UV radiation levels for various applications, including weather stations, UV index monitoring devices, and personal UV exposure trackers.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **VEML6070 UV Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**
- **Power Supply**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the UV Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the SDA (Data) pin of VEML6070 to GPIO pin D2 on ESP8266.
   - Connect the SCL (Clock) pin of VEML6070 to GPIO pin D1 on ESP8266.
   - Ensure a common ground (GND) connection between the ESP8266 and VEML6070.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 for debugging purposes.
   - Begin I2C communication using `Wire.begin(D2, D1)` with respective GPIO pins for SDA and SCL.
   - Verify communication with the VEML6070 sensor using `veml.begin()`. Display an error message if communication fails.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the UV Index value using `veml.readUVI()`.
     - Print the UV Index value to the Serial Monitor.
     - Add a delay (`delay(1000)`) between readings to ensure stable sensor readings.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Sensor Calibration:** Ensure the VEML6070 sensor is calibrated according to manufacturer specifications for accurate UV Index readings.
   - **Power Supply:** Provide stable power to both ESP8266 and the VEML6070 sensor to ensure reliable operation.
   - **Environmental Factors:** Consider environmental conditions such as ambient light and temperature, which can affect UV sensor readings.

#### Applications
- **UV Monitoring:** Monitor UV radiation levels for outdoor activities and health safety.
- **Weather Stations:** Integrate UV index data into weather monitoring systems.
- **Personal Devices:** Build devices to track personal UV exposure for health and safety.

#### Notes
- **I2C Communication:** VEML6070 uses I2C protocol for communication, allowing easy integration with microcontrollers like ESP8266.
- **Serial Output:** Use the Serial Monitor to observe and debug UV index measurements and sensor operations.
